# CodeMind Documentation

Welcome to the CodeMind documentation. This directory contains comprehensive guides for understanding and working with the Intelligent Code Auxiliary System.

## 🚀 Getting Started

- [Quick Start Guide](QUICKSTART.md) - Get up and running in 5 minutes
- [Usage Guide](USAGE_GUIDE.md) - Detailed usage instructions and examples

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

- [Knowledge Integration System](architecture/KNOWLEDGE_INTEGRATION_SYSTEM.md) - Core knowledge management architecture
- [High Impact Features Design](architecture/HIGH_IMPACT_FEATURES_DESIGN.md) - Key system features and design decisions

## 🌳 Tree Traversal System (New!)

- [Tree Traversal Overview](tree-traversal.md) - Complete guide to the class traversal system

The tree traversal system provides advanced class analysis capabilities:
- **Multiple traversal types**: Inheritance chains, composition trees, dependency graphs
- **Role-specific focus**: Tailored analysis for different developer roles  
- **Quick finding**: Fast class and method location with relevance scoring
- **Conceptual mapping**: Understand relationships between code concepts
- **Performance optimization**: Efficient analysis of large codebases
